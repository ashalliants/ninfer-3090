# Tests

The retained tests protect current `.ninfer`, numerical operator, model, runtime-transaction,
benchmark-report, and external protocol behavior. Op qualification and CUDA implementation rules
are defined in [Op development](../docs/maintainer/op-development.md); product execution and
ownership contracts are defined in [Engine architecture](../docs/maintainer/engine-architecture.md).

## Organization

- `artifact/` — v3 framing, directory/binding records, codecs, sharding, selected-object
  materialization and Python-writer/C++-reader interoperability;
- `convert/` — source interpretation, Qwen logical mapping, recipe overrides/sharing, optional
  components, resources, proposals and numerical conversion methods;
- `models/qwen3_5/` — config/binding, frontend, state/context stores, workspace, MTP alignment and
  opt-in real Engine integration;
- `ops/` — semantic Op qualification with independent mathematical or state-transition oracles;
  Linear and fused Linear suites are separated by their supported weight/activation paths;
- `runtime/` — scheduler fairness, cache resource policy, capacity and context-cost calculations;
- `bench/ttft/` — HTTP measurements, campaign orchestration and workload construction;
- root C++ tests — core storage, public API, serving protocols, logging, benchmark reports and
  causal-scoring evaluation;
- `test_serve_corpus.py` — agreement between the serving request-log schema and its measurement
  consumer.

Tests are grouped by observable risk, not by mirroring every source file or class.
`CMakeLists.txt` includes explicit registrations from `cmake/`, `artifact/`, `models/qwen3_5/`
and `ops/`. Registration helpers live in `cmake/NinferTests.cmake`; included manifests keep
executables and CTest working directories under `build/tests/`.

Tests link into one executable, `ninfer_tests`, rather than one each: every test that links the
Op library would otherwise carry its own copy of the whole kernel image (~450 MB on sm_86), which
added up to tens of GB. Each test keeps its name as a program in the bundle and still runs in its
own process under CTest. Run one by hand with `build/tests/ninfer_tests <name> [args...]`;
`ninfer_tests --list` prints the names. Tests registered `STANDALONE` in the CMake files (for example
`ninfer_jinja_test` and `ninfer_artifact_materialization_test`, which Python tests invoke by path) stay
in their own executables; `cmake/NinferTests.cmake` says why.
A test's helpers and entry function must be internal (anonymous namespace) so that programs do not
collide at link time. The mechanism is `cmake/NinferBundles.cmake`.
`ops/op_tester.h` and `ops/op_check.h` own only reusable device/guard and comparison mechanics.
Concrete numerical criteria remain named by the semantic Op suite; there are no cross-Op tolerance
presets.

`ops/quantized_weight.h` is the common packed-weight fixture for Q4/Q5/Q6/Q8, FP8 and NVFP4 Op tests. It
owns deterministic payload generation, device `Weight` views, row views, and independent logical
weight decoding.

## Build and run

Select a Python environment with the dependencies for the tests first. The maintained environment
uses Python 3.11; CMake finds Python 3 without restricting its minor version.
`Python3_EXECUTABLE` selects the interpreter used by the interop tests explicitly.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$(command -v python3)"
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Alternatively, `cmake --preset dev` enables products, tests and benchmarks together.
After building, `ctest --preset dev` runs the same CTest suite. See
[Build system](../docs/maintainer/build-system.md) for local interpreter presets.

The chat-template reference test uses Python Jinja2.

Run a focused target for a localized change:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_tests
ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_sampling_test --output-on-failure
```

Enable uniform floating-point error records when establishing or reviewing an Op criterion:

```bash
NINFER_OP_REPORT_STATS=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build -V -R '^ninfer_(rmsnorm|softmax_attention)_test$'
```

Every participating comparison emits one `OP_ERROR_STATS` record containing the stable case label,
actual error, active limit, and error-to-limit ratio. The switch changes reporting only; the same
statistics still drive the normal verdict. Passing tests remain quiet without it.

## Running a test under compute-sanitizer

`memcheck` and `initcheck` both work on these binaries, including the large statically linked ones.
Invoke it unqualified so `PATH` resolves it:

```bash
compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck --error-exitcode 9 \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_softmax_attention_test
```

**Do not call the copy under `CUDA/v12.4/compute-sanitizer/` by absolute path.** Two copies are
installed on a typical toolkit layout, and the 2024.1.0 one in v12.4 prints its banner and
`ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors`, exits 0, and **never executes the binary** — a clean report having
checked nothing. `PATH` resolves `compute-sanitizer` to the v12.8 launcher, which is the working
one, so the unqualified form above is safe.

Two messages that look like failures and are not:

- *"Target application terminated before first instrumented API call"* — the test made no CUDA
  calls, usually because it skipped for a missing `NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT` (or `NINFER_TEST_GRAFT`)
  environment variable. Set the variable, or pick a test that does not need one.
- A single `-k 'regex:a|b'`-style argument disappearing in PowerShell: `|` is parsed as a pipeline
  before the tool sees it. One pattern per invocation.

`ncu` needs one thing more: GPU performance counters are administrator-only by default on Windows
and it fails with `ERR_NVGPUCTRPERM` otherwise. Run it from an elevated shell — that satisfies the
permission per-run, with nothing persistent and no reboot.
`scripts/sweeps/admin-profile.ps1` does this for the profiles the maintainer notes reference.

The variable-width DFlash2 target-attention subset can be run with
`./build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_softmax_attention_test --dflash2-only`. It covers D256/Q24/KV4 across all five
cache codecs, W=2..16, B=1..8, request-local prefixes, cache effects, and Graph metadata/input
updates. The default executable also runs the existing attention geometries and prefill tests.

Linear tests are independently runnable by weight and activation-compute profile:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_tests
ctest --test-dir build -R '^ninfer_linear_(q4|q5|q6|q8)_a16_test$' --output-on-failure
```

For a change confined to one Q8 geometry, use the same public conformance cases with
`./build/tests/ninfer_linear_q8_a16_test --shape N K`. The default CTest invocation still covers
all registered Q8 geometries.

For a change confined to a newly supported BF16 geometry, use
`./build/tests/ninfer_linear_bf16_a16_test --shape N K`. These cases use the common full-K FP64
oracle with exact BF16 weights, complete output checks for small N, route boundaries, changed-input
Graph replay, both public overloads, workspace domains, and preservation/guard checks. The small
control projections also cover terminal-K pulses and paired cancellation.

All Linear files use `ops/linear/linear_test_common.{h,cpp}` and the same
`ops/quantized_weight.h` fixture as the fused projection tests. The fixture produces the complete
packed GPU payload and exact-decodes the logical float rows used by the one
`cpu_linear_gemm_fp64()` reference. The reference performs naive double accumulation and never
reproduces a production route's activation quantization, staging, reduction tree, or BF16 output
rounding. Each activation compute path selects one centrally defined comparison tolerance for its
whole suite; private kernel, schedule, launcher, and T selection do not change it. Individual test
files call public `linear()` and contain no private selector, launcher, schedule, or kernel
assertions.

The Q8 suite includes `[2560,6144]`, `[6144,2560]`, `[10240,2560]`, `[12288,2560]`, and
`[16384,2560]`: full-output FP64 comparisons at T=1/4/8,
sampled-output checks at larger extents including 512/1024 and 129/1025, production boundaries,
changed-input Graph replay, both public overloads, permissive policies, input/weight preservation,
output guards, and valid/invalid workspace intervals.

The Linear, LinearAdd and LinearSwiGLU common `.cpp` implementations each compile once into a
test support library. Both those libraries and the Op test executables receive the oracle's
`-fno-fast-math` and `-ffp-contract=off` options on GNU/Clang C++ compilers.

Run the native Python suites with the project Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m pytest \
  tests/artifact tests/convert tests/bench/ttft \
  tests/test_serve_corpus.py
```

The Python suites exercise conversion, encoded output and measurement tools without model inference.
The maintained environment uses Python 3.11 with the dependencies for those suites. C++ binding and Engine tests
cover consumption of their resulting representation.

The GGML block decoders, Python (`tests/artifact/test_ggml_codecs.py`) and C++
(`ninfer_ggml_blocks_decode_test`, for the host oracle `tests/ops/ggml_blocks_decode.h`), are
checked against committed golden fixtures from ggml's reference `dequantize_row_*`
(`tests/fixtures/ggml/<format>.blocks` and `.f32`). `ninfer_artifact_ggml_real_test` loads a real
GGML artifact named by `NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT` (such as `--subset dev` below) through Device, Pinned
and Host residency and requires the C++ and Python decoders to agree bit for bit on sampled blocks,
including blocks of every part of the expert records; it skips without the variable or when that
artifact has no GGML tensor. `tests/artifact/test_ngram_volume.py` covers the n-gram volume file
(header fields, block geometry at the real table, exact row placement, the 512-row reuse check).
Optional environment variables extend the Python GGML and GGUF checks:

| Variable | Adds |
|---|---|
| `NINFER_GGML_BASE_DLL` | the live oracle: ggml-base (`.dll` or `.so`) of llama.cpp b11316 decodes 100,000 random blocks per format, and 1,000 real blocks per format with `NINFER_TEST_GGUF` |
| `NINFER_TEST_GGUF` | the real Qwen3.8-Flash-Next GGUF (first split file): tensor inventory, whole-model name map and expert record bytes, export conventions and hash parameters, and a `--subset dev` conversion and its n-gram volume compared byte for byte against the GGUF, expert records through their exact inverse (~2.9 GB in the test's temporary directory) |
| `NINFER_TEST_QWEN4EXP_SUBSET` | verify that existing `--subset dev` artifact, and the volume beside it as `<artifact>.ngram`, instead of converting one |
| `NINFER_TEST_QWEN38_ARTIFACT` | a Qwen3.8 `.ninfer` whose tokenizer the GGUF vocabulary must equal |

`python -m tools.artifact.gen_ggml_fixtures --dll PATH` regenerates the fixtures.

`ninfer_linear_ggml_test` qualifies Linear and LinearAdd over the six GGML formats they register,
at every registered problem and T in {1..8, 9, 63, 64, 65, 300}: the weight is decoded by that host
oracle, the activation passes through an independent host copy of the contract's Q8_1 cast, and
the output is compared with the FP64 product. It also checks the cast exactly, byte for byte against
the wide route's cast kernel and through the public Op on both routes, and the admission rules.
`--format NAME` and `--shape N K` select problems; the full run takes about a minute, most of it the
host oracle.

`ninfer_offloaded_moe_cpu_test` (host only) and `ninfer_offloaded_moe_layer_test` qualify
offloaded_sparse_moe over the three GGML expert record formats. The CPU test checks the canonical A8
cast bit for bit against an independent FP64 formulation, the exact sub-block decode of IQ2_S,
IQ2_XXS, IQ1_M and Q2_0 against the host decoder above, the CPU expert engine against the FP64
expert oracle at T in {1, 2, 7, 8}, and AVX2, scalar and the worker team at 1-16 workers for equal
bits. The layer test checks routing (exact top-10 with ties to the lower id) and dispatch exactly,
then requires every routed output of the GPU narrow route to equal the CPU engine's bits for records
in device frames, read zero-copy, staged through 1, 3 or 64 slots, and served by the CPU miss service
at 1 and 6 workers (T in {1, 2, 7, 8, 16}), and the whole layer, with a shared expert composed of
GGML linears and the combine, against FP64. With `NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT` it repeats the placements on
32 real experts of every expert bank of the artifact. `--small` runs a reduced set for
compute-sanitizer.

The real loading test accepts an explicit artifact path and optional component selection:

```bash
./build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_loading_real_test \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer --vision --speculative mtp --proposal optimized
```

Add `--host-only` to check semantic binding without uploading weights. This does not construct a
Program or establish native Op support.

The C++ prefix/MTP integration test is separately opt-in because it loads the full artifact and
runs the real engine:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_prefix_real_test --output-on-failure
```

The causal-scoring integration test uses the same artifact variable and checks a full 1,024-column
score tile, overlapping target suffixes, and repeated-window State/KV isolation:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_score_real_test --output-on-failure
```

Run the 35B-A3B MoE route independently:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_moe_real_test --output-on-failure
```

Without `NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT`, CTest marks these real Engine tests as skipped. Real-artifact targets
carry the `real` label and `RUN_SERIAL` so CTest runs them alone. Run directly invoked GPU
integration tests serially. `NINFER_PREFIX_REAL_SCENARIO` selects a focused prefix scenario such as
`vision`, `late-instructions` or `concurrent`; the default is `all`. These integration checks
use behavior and state accounting rather than another numerical path's generated tokens as a golden.

The `attention` scenario checks the selected KV type, chunked prefill, concurrent Graph decode
across a resource tier, prefix continuation, and workspace bounds:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
NINFER_PREFIX_REAL_SCENARIO=attention NINFER_TEST_KV_DTYPE=fp8 \
NINFER_TEST_SPECULATIVE=mtp NINFER_TEST_BATCH=2 \
  ./build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_prefix_real_test
```

KV choices are `bf16`, `int8`, `fp8`, `nvfp4`, and `k8v4`; backend choices are `none`, `mtp`,
`dflash`, and `dflash2`, requiring an artifact with the selected component. Batch defaults to 2;
`NINFER_TEST_DRAFT_TOKENS` overrides the default MTP3 or DFlash7 block. The DFlash2-specific
integration executable also accepts all five KV names as its fifth positional argument and rejects
unknown names.

Continuation and pressure recovery have dedicated entries:

```bash
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_agent_continuation_real_test --output-on-failure

NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
NINFER_TEST_BACKEND=dflash2 \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_5_preemption_real_test --output-on-failure

NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=$PWD/out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  ./build/tests/ninfer_qwen3_5_native_transactions_test dflash2
```

The agent entry checks multi-turn continuation and branching. The preemption entry exercises
Snapshot/Replay recovery and cancellation while paused or replaying; `NINFER_PREEMPTION_REAL_SCENARIO`
selects `all`, `snapshot`, `replay`, `cancel-paused` or `cancel-replay`. Native transaction tests cover
physical state/KV ownership, binding, capture, reclamation and abort; their positional backend is
`none`, `mtp`, `dflash` or `dflash2`. Each backend requires an artifact containing that component.
Public-HTTP latency and output gaps are measured separately by the
[TTFT campaign](../tools/bench/ttft/README.md).

`ninfer_qwen3_5_tools_real_test [none|mtp|dflash|dflash2] [graph|eager|basic|snapshot|replay|cancel] [concurrency]`
uses `NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT` for strict tools, thinking, raw continuation, mixed batches, and
call/result prefix reuse, and required-tool → JSON continuation with committed constraint observations.
`basic` checks default constraints with open/complex schemas, continuation,
streaming and mixed strict/basic/free rows. Snapshot/Replay modes force resource pressure and
validate the completed argument value after recovery; `cancel` interrupts the paused request.
`NINFER_TEST_TOOL_REPORT` appends schema/output/timing JSONL.
`python3 tests/models/qwen3_5/test_tool_schema.py` checks the native Qwen grammar and decoder against
`jsonschema` (dependencies in `tests/text/requirements.txt`), including string pattern/Unicode-length
intersections. The JSON Schema oracle also covers finite-value filtering, reference/union siblings,
closed-object and positional-array intersections, draft-07 tuples, recursive conjunctions,
numeric endpoints and JSON publication rounding. HTTP parsing tests check schema-number precision
before protocol adapters serialize the schema.

`ninfer_qwen3_5_grammar_real_test [none|mtp|dflash|dflash2] [graph|eager] [concurrency] [vision]` uses
`NINFER_TEST_DRAFT_TOKENS` to override the default draft count of three and
`NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT` to check GBNF/JSON/schema/choice/regex content, sampling, thinking, continuation, prefix reuse
and mixed batches. `ninfer_regex_choice_test` checks literal-set prefix masks and regex edge cases;
`python3 tests/text/test_regex_choice.py` compares regex membership with independent fullmatch semantics.
Set `NINFER_TEST_CONSTRAINT=grammar` or `json_schema` on the preemption test to
check matcher continuity through Snapshot/Replay and cancellation. `ninfer_grammar_test` and
`ninfer_json_schema_test` cover CPU language semantics. `ninfer_json_schema_oracle_test` compares
supported schemas with the independent Python `jsonschema` validator; install its dependency with
`python3 -m pip install -r tests/text/requirements.txt` in the selected test environment.
The sampling and speculative Op tests qualify masks against independent mathematical oracles.

The capability-evaluation coordinator has its own environment and unittest entry point:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=eval eval/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover \
  -s eval/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

Run the serving contract manually after starting a resident server in another terminal:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080 --vision
```

```bash
python3 -m tools.smoke.serve_contract \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 --model qwen3.6-27b
```

This smoke check is intentionally not a CTest: it needs the real artifact, a supported GPU, and a
server process that remains alive while the client exercises OpenAI Responses/Chat, Anthropic,
state, streaming, and multimodal requests.

The thinking-preservation fixture starts and stops its own server, submits a fixed two-step tool
history, compares stripped and preserved closed-turn prompt lengths, and verifies compatible
prefix reuse, speculative execution, frontier bounds and Responses inheritance:

```bash
python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer --backend mtp

python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer --backend dflash
```

The shared messages are in
[`fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json`](fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json).

## What belongs here

A permanent test should protect one current risk, such as:

- exact artifact bytes, geometry, object binding, or conversion transform;
- a numerical operator contract with an independent oracle;
- model Frontend or Program frontier, prefix, MTP, or multimodal behavior;
- generated-token commit/stop/cancel consistency;
- public benchmark or OpenAI/Anthropic observable behavior;
- a reproduced supported bug.

Performance-only assertions belong in benchmarks and profiler review. Source scans,
implementation-shape assertions, trivial getters/configuration, retired command surfaces, and
broad additions without a concrete regression risk do not belong in the permanent suite.

## DFlash2 Engine integration

The DFlash prefill regression checks actual KV contents after a StateImage fork and a conflicting
decode binding, including shortened chunks and oversized local/full KV appends. It uses native
Program storage and the production prefill route; select the draft component stored in the artifact:

```bash
cmake --build build -j --target ninfer_tests
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash_prefill_real_test dflash2
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash_prefill_real_test dflash
```

The Engine test uses an artifact containing DFlash2 and checks output budgets, speculative activity,
forced thinking-control append, penalty-enabled sampling, compact batches with unequal budgets,
same-route same-seed replay, retained/fresh prefix behavior and absence of a full backend KV pool.
A shared DFlash/DFlash2 fixture starts decode at token 63, verifies across the page boundary, stops
after one target column at token 64, and checks the exact retained frontier and subsequent generation
with and without reuse.
The KV Store test checks exact mapping and reservation accounting for the same transition.
K>=7 also exercises a stop inside a licensed block; K=15 additionally checks oversized prefill,
local ring wrap, and the logical context-capacity tail. Optional Vision runs image/video capture
and prefix restore. Zero extra Device StateImage slots exercise Host snapshot/restore.

```bash
cmake --build build -j --target ninfer_tests
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash2_real_test 15 1 1 8
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash2_real_test 7 1 0 2 bf16 1 0
NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_tests ninfer_qwen3_5_dflash2_real_test 2 0 0 2 int8
```

Arguments are K, Graph enabled, optimized head enabled, maximum B, target KV (`bf16`, `int8`,
`fp8`, `nvfp4`, or `k8v4`), Vision enabled, and extra Device StateImage slots. Defaults are
`15 1 1 8 bf16 0 3`. Run GPU integration tests serially. The individual Op suites remain the
numerical/state-transition oracle; the fixed Engine fixture does not define bit parity across
arbitrary floating-point routes.
